# Python-Math-Logic-Lab
A lab in our coding class about python logic.
This code defines three simple functions.
The first function calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle. It takes two side lengths, squares each one, adds them together, and returns the square root of the sum using the math library.

The second function counts how many digits are in a number. It first makes the number positive so negatives do not affect the count, converts the number to text, and then returns the length of that text. This works correctly for integers.

The third function calculates a tip amount. It takes the total bill and a percentage, converts the percentage to a decimal, and multiplies it by the total to return the tip value.
